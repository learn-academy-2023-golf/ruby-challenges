# ‚ù§Ô∏è Challenges
# As a developer, I can create a hash called my_phone using the Ruby method .new.

# As a developer, I can add five key:value pairs of phone application names and their descriptions to my hash.

p my_phone

# As a developer, I can return a value from my_phone by passing in the name of a key.

# As a developer, I can update two keys in my_phone.
my_phone[:All_Trails] = my_phone.delete(:AllTrails)

# As a developer, I can update two values in my_phone.

# As a developer, I can delete two key:value pairs from my_phone.
